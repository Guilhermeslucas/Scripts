A repository for some introductory stuff code on Shell Script.

I did some of these while I was learning and trying to improve 
my skills on Shell Script.
Besides, the codes in this repository helps me on daily tasks.

To run these scritps type:
```
chmod +x <script name> (just the first time)
./<script name>
```
